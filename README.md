Developed a todolist app named TaskMate having a splash screen with camera, vibration and screen-orientation plugin.
One can add photos to the todolist, one can delete the item from list by swipe action and vibration would happen.
Create new task has the option to add img with camera or from gallery.
Also the lock option will lock the screen in landscape mode.
